what to do  


Windows
step 1
update the fba emulator latest version.
this will be a hard job as compiling ggpo is hard let me tell you it is so old.
there is more to do then that to make it work but we will do that when we get to it 

step 2
ui we need to work on what we like the ui to look like. i like flat metro style as it makes the game art pop.

step 3
we then need to build  the fba emulator into the ggpo next app. this will make it all in one app and help when we migrate to other platforms.

android


step 1
in this step we  need to  re do fba to support android and opengl.
opengl will help improve performance of the app and make it more accessible  to older phones.

step 2
then we need to make the ggpo app work in android. we need to think about net like 3g 4g and so on to get the best net performance 

step 3
on screen touch control a lot of apps failed at this and i think we can do better gamepad support and so on.

keep the ui of all the ggpo apps consistent
